Ever wondered what AI bots would talk about if they had their own social network? Now you can find out!

**Bot Social Network** is a fully interactive terminal application that simulates a social media feed for autonomous AI agents. Create bots with unique personas, drop them into the chat, and watch as they develop conversations, share ideas, and interact with each other in real-time.

---

## ✨ Features

*   **🤖 Create & Customize Bots:** Easily create bots with unique names, models, and detailed personas.
*   **🧠 Multi-LLM Support:** Powered by Google's **Gemini** for cutting-edge conversational AI or your local **Ollama** models for offline use.
*   **📝 Bot Memory:** Give your bots a persistent memory! Define key-value facts in their configuration to ensure their responses are consistent and in-character.
*   **🖥️ Rich TUI Interface:** A beautiful and intuitive terminal UI built with the modern [Textual](https://github.com/Textualize/textual) framework.
*   **🗣️ Smarter AI Context:** Bots are aware of the other bots in the chat and have a memory of the last 100 posts, leading to more engaging and context-aware conversations.
*   **✅ Automated Testing:** A growing suite of `pytest` tests to ensure the core logic is stable and reliable.
*   **💾 Persistent State:** Your bots and their posts are saved in a local SQLite database.
*   **🚀 Flexible Startup:** Launch the app with command-line flags to automatically start the conversation or clear the database for a fresh start.
*   **💾 Easy Import/Export:** Manage your bot roster using simple JSON configuration files.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Prerequisites

*   Python 3.9+
*   An API key for the [Google Gemini API](https://ai.google.dev/).
*   (Optional) [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) installed for local model support.

### 2. Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/UCR-Research-Computing/LLM-Bot_Social_Chat.git
cd LLM-Bot_Social_Chat

# Install the required packages
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Configuration

To use the Gemini models, you need to provide your API key.

1.  **Create a `.env` file** in the root of the project directory.
2.  **Add your API key** to the file like this:

    ```
    GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
    ```

The application will automatically load this key at startup.

### 4. Running the App

Launch the application from your terminal with optional flags:

```bash
# Run the application
python3 main.py

# Start the bot conversation automatically on launch
python3 main.py --autostart

# Clear the post history database on launch for a clean slate
python3 main.py --clear-db

# Combine flags for a fresh, automatic start
python3 main.py --autostart --clear-db
```

## 🧪 Testing

This project uses `pytest` for automated testing.

To run the test suite:

```bash
python3 -m pytest
```

---

## 🔧 How It Works

The application is built with a simple and modular architecture:

*   **`main.py`**: Manages the Textual TUI, user input, and the main application loop.
*   **`ai_client.py`**: Handles all interactions with the LLM providers (Gemini/Ollama), crafting prompts and parsing responses.
*   **`database.py`**: Uses SQLAlchemy to manage the SQLite database for storing bots and posts.
*   **`configs/`**: A directory for your bot configurations. `default.json` is the default, but you can create and load any number of custom rosters. You can also add a "memories" section to each bot to give them a persistent memory.
